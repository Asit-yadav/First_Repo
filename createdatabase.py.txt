Date function
Date Functions Basics:

Date functions use a keyword and parentheses, e.g., NOW().
Some functions take arguments, while others don’t, e.g., NOW() vs DATEDIFF().
Current Date and Time:

NOW() retrieves both the current date and time.
CURDATE() retrieves only the current date.
Extracting Date or Time:

Use DATE() to extract the date from a date-time field, e.g., DATE(NOW()).
SQL stores dates as year-month-day, so respect the format when adding records.
Formatting Dates:

Use DATE_FORMAT(date, format) to display dates in a specific format, e.g., MM/DD/YYYY.
Use a column alias to make headers look clean when formatting.
Date Differences and Calculations:

DATEDIFF(date1, date2) returns the difference in days between two dates.
ADDDATE() adds an interval (day, month, etc.) to a date, e.g., ADDDATE(orderDate, INTERVAL 2 DAY).
Day and Month Extraction:

Use DAY() and MONTH() to extract the numerical day and month.
Use DAYNAME() and MONTHNAME() for the actual names of the day or month.
Applications:

Date functions are useful for mail merges, reports, and email automation.
Ensure correct formatting when working with date-time data to avoid errors.
Example:

If you want just the date portion of NOW(), use DATE(NOW()).
To calculate shipping delays: DATEDIFF(shippedDate, orderDate) will return the number of days between the order and shipment.


Here are the key points from the demonstration on the TRIM and SUBSTR functions:

TRIM Functions:

TRIM removes leading and trailing spaces from text fields. Useful for cleaning up data entry errors.
LTRIM (Left Trim) removes leading spaces (before the text).
RTRIM (Right Trim) removes trailing spaces (after the text).
Example: " Shad" is different from "Shad", but TRIM(" Shad") will return "Shad".
SUBSTR Function:

SUBSTR(field, start_position, length) extracts a portion of a string.
Useful for extracting parts of strings like phone numbers or ZIP codes.
Example: SUBSTR("Shad", 1, 3) returns "Sha".
Importance of Consistency:

Consistent data entry ensures you can extract and format data correctly, such as consistently including country codes in phone numbers.
The functions are essential for cleaning up text fields and extracting specific portions of data from strings.







Concatenation in SQL joins multiple strings using the CONCAT function, with each string separated by a comma. For example: CONCAT(firstName, ' ', lastName) combines the first and last names with a space. To handle unwanted spaces, use TRIM before concatenating.

The CONCAT_WS function lets you specify a separator between strings, useful for formatting addresses or labels. For example: CONCAT_WS(' ', firstName, lastName).

You can also concatenate special characters like $ for currency formatting: CONCAT('$', ROUND(amount, 2)).
Functions Overview

Functions perform designated actions and return results.
Called using the syntax: functionName(argument1, argument2, ...).
Data Types

Date and Time:
Formats:
Dates: YYYY-MM-DD
Times: HH:MM:SS
Types: DATE, TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, YEAR.
Date Functions

NOW(): Current date and time.
CURDATE(): Current date.
DATEDIFF(date1, date2): Difference between two dates (earlier date first for a positive result).
DATE_FORMAT(date, format): Formats dates based on specified format.
WEEKDAY(date): Returns day of the week (0 = Monday).
MONTH(date), DAYNAME(date), MONTHNAME(date), YEAR(date): Extract respective components.
Distinct and Aggregate Functions

DISTINCT: Eliminates duplicate values.
Aggregate Functions:
AVG(): Average value.
COUNT(expression): Counts non-NULL values; COUNT(*) includes NULLs.
MAX(), MIN(): Highest and lowest values (ignores NULLs).
SUM(): Total of numeric values.
String Functions

Strings enclosed in single quotes; MySQL ignores case.
Formatting Functions:
UPPER(), LOWER(): Convert case.
REPLACE(original, old_value, new_value): Replaces occurrences.
FORMAT(number, decimal_places): Formats numbers.
Trimming Functions:
LTRIM(), RTRIM(), TRIM(): Removes leading, trailing, or both spaces.
Substring Extraction:
SUBSTRING(string, start_position, length): Extracts part of a string.
Concatenation

Use CONCAT(string1, string2, ...) to join strings.
CONCAT_WS(delimiter, string1, string2, ...) to join with a specified delimiter.



Summary of UNION in SQL
UNION Overview:

UNION is used to combine the results of two or more queries into one result set.
Queries combined using UNION must have:
The same number of columns.
Compatible data types for corresponding columns.
Example:

In a video rental store database, actor and customer tables both contain first and last names.
By using UNION, we can combine the first and last names from both tables into a single result.
Key Points:

UNION returns unique records by default.
To include all records, even duplicates, use UNION ALL.
UNION is useful for scenarios like merging current and old customers for specific purposes, like mailing lists.


Summary of INTERSECT and EXCEPT Operators in SQL
INTERSECT:

Compares the results of two SELECT statements and returns the rows that are common to both.
The queries must retrieve the same number of columns with compatible data types.
Example: If two tables (vips and vips2) contain names, INTERSECT returns names that appear in both tables.
EXCEPT:

Returns the rows from the first query that do not exist in the second.
Like INTERSECT, it requires the same number of columns and compatible data types.
Example: EXCEPT can be used to find names in vips that are not present in vips2.
Key Points:

INTERSECT: Returns common records between two result sets.
EXCEPT: Returns records from the first result set that are not in the second.
Both operators provide unique results, meaning duplicates are automatically removed.


Key Points on Joins:
Joins Overview:

Joins combine data from two or more tables based on a common column or condition.
Essential for reconstructing flat database-like results from normalized tables.
Types of Joins:

Cross Join:

Matches every row from the first table with every row from the second.
Rarely used; creates a result set of all possible combinations.
Syntax: SELECT * FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2;
Inner Join:

Retrieves only records where there is a match between both tables based on the join condition.
Most commonly used.
Example: Fetch VIPs with matching addresses:
sql
Copy code
SELECT vip.name, vip_address.address 
FROM vip 
INNER JOIN vip_address ON vip.vip_number = vip_address.vip_number;
Outer Joins:

Left Outer Join:
Returns all records from the left (first) table and matching records from the right table. If no match, right table columns return NULL.
Syntax: SELECT * FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON condition;
Right Outer Join:
Returns all records from the right (second) table and matching records from the left table.
Syntax: SELECT * FROM table1 RIGHT JOIN table2 ON condition;
Using Common Columns:

If the fields in the join condition have the same name, you can use the USING clause to simplify the query:
sql
Copy code
SELECT * 
FROM table1 
INNER JOIN table2 USING (common_column);

sql
Copy code
SELECT customer.first_name, customer.last_name, address.postal_code, city.city
FROM customer
INNER JOIN address ON customer.address_id = address.address_id
INNER JOIN city ON address.city_id = city.city_id;
Field Ambiguity: If fields exist in more than one table, you must specify the table name (e.g., customer.first_name).

Classic Models Example:

Joining customers, orders, and orderdetails:
sql
Copy code
SELECT customers.customerNumber, customers.customerName, orders.orderNumber, orders.orderDate, orderdetails.quantityOrdered
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders ON customers.customerNumber = orders.customerNumber
INNER JOIN orderdetails ON orders.orderNumber = orderdetails.orderNumber;
Summary:
Multiple Table Joins involve combining data from several tables based on shared keys.
INNER JOIN retrieves only matching rows from related tables.
Understanding the relationships (keys) is key to correctly forming the join queries.


Key Points on Self Joins:
Self Join Overview:

A self join is not a different type of join but rather a scenario where a table is joined to itself.
It allows you to relate records within the same table.
Table Aliases:

Table aliases make it easier to write and read queries by providing shorter names for tables.
Essential for self joins since you need to refer to the same table multiple times.
Example Scenario:

Employees Table: Contains an employee's details and their supervisor's employee number (reportsTo).
Example Query:
sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    t1.employee_number,
    CONCAT(t1.first_name, ' ', t1.last_name) AS employee,
    CONCAT(t2.first_name, ' ', t2.last_name) AS supervisor
FROM 
    employees AS t1
LEFT JOIN 
    employees AS t2 ON t1.reportsTo = t2.employee_number
WHERE 
    t1.reportsTo IS NOT NULL;
Results:

This query generates a list of employees along with their respective supervisors by treating the employees table as two separate instances (t1 and t2).
Conclusion:
Self joins use the same table twice with aliases to relate fields within that table, enabling the retrieval of hierarchical or related data from a single source.




Key Points on Data Sorting:
Overview of Data Sorting:

Data sorting organizes query results in a specified order.
In the Sakila database, initial queries return unsorted results.
Sorting Syntax:

Use the ORDER BY clause to specify the sorting field.
Example:
sql
Copy code
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customer ORDER BY first_name, last_name;
Sorting Order:

Default order is ascending (A-Z for letters, smallest to largest for numbers).
To sort in descending order, use DESC:
sql
Copy code
ORDER BY field_name DESC;
To explicitly indicate ascending order (optional):
sql
Copy code
ORDER BY field_name ASC;
Custom Sort Order:

For custom sorting, use the FIELD() function.
Example:
sql
Copy code
SELECT f.title, c.name 
FROM films f 
INNER JOIN film_category fc ON f.film_id = fc.film_id 
INNER JOIN categories c ON fc.category_id = c.category_id 
ORDER BY FIELD(c.name, 'Action', 'Comedy', 'Foreign', 'New', 'Animation', 'Documentary', 'Games');
This allows for sorting in a user-defined order.
Conclusion:
Data sorting enhances query results with the ORDER BY clause.
Use ASC for ascending, DESC for descending, or FIELD() for custom orders to meet specific sorting requirements.
This should provide a clear and concise overview of data sorting based on the demonstration!



Here’s a more concise summary of limiting results in SQL:

Limiting Results in SQL
Overview:

MySQL uses LIMIT to fetch a specified number of records (unlike SQL Server's TOP).
Basic Usage:

Fetch the top N records:
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM payment ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 10;
Offset:

Specify starting point:
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM payment ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 100, 10; 
Retrieves 10 records starting from the 101st.






GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses
GROUP BY:

Used to group rows that share a common value in specified columns.
Essential for performing aggregate calculations on grouped data.
Basic Syntax:

sql
Copy code
SELECT column_name, COUNT(*) 
FROM table_name 
GROUP BY column_name;
Example: Count films in each store:
sql
Copy code
SELECT store_id, COUNT(film_id) 
FROM inventory 
GROUP BY store_id;
Multiple Grouping:

You can group by multiple columns:
sql
Copy code
SELECT rating, rental_duration, COUNT(*) 
FROM films 
GROUP BY rating, rental_duration 
ORDER BY rating;
HAVING:

Filters grouped records. Similar to WHERE, but works with aggregate functions.
Syntax:
sql
Copy code
SELECT column_name, SUM(amount) 
FROM payments 
GROUP BY customer_id 
HAVING SUM(amount) > 120;
Use HAVING when you need to limit results based on aggregate values.
Key Points:

Use GROUP BY to aggregate data.
Use HAVING instead of WHERE to filter aggregated results.



ROLLUP Operator in SQL
Purpose:

Produces a hierarchical series of grouping sets, summarizing data at multiple levels.
How It Works:

The order of grouping columns determines the hierarchy.
Each grouping level generates a subtotal, with a grand total at the end.
Example 1: Basic Usage of ROLLUP:

sql
Copy code
SELECT rating, special_features, COUNT(*)
FROM films
GROUP BY rating, special_features WITH ROLLUP;
This query counts special features grouped by film ratings. The output includes subtotals for each rating and a grand total.
Example 2: Changing Grouping Order:

sql
Copy code
SELECT special_features, rating, COUNT(*)
FROM films
GROUP BY special_features, rating WITH ROLLUP;
Changing the order of grouping columns affects the number of rows in the output.
Handling NULLs in Output:

By default, ROLLUP produces NULLs for subtotal rows. Use the GROUPING function to differentiate subtotal rows.
Example 3: Using GROUPING and IF Functions:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    IF(GROUPING(rating) = 1, 'All Ratings', rating) AS Rating,
    IF(GROUPING(special_features) = 1, 'All Special Features', special_features) AS SF,
    COUNT(*) AS SF_Count
FROM films
GROUP BY rating, special_features WITH ROLLUP;
This query replaces NULLs with labels like "All Ratings" and "All Special Features" for better readability.
Key Takeaways:

ROLLUP allows for hierarchical summarization.
The grouping order impacts output rows.
Use GROUPING and IF functions to handle NULLs and provide meaningful labels.
